My take on this project tackles the issue of escapism in someone’s daily life cranked to eleven. Presented as a reconstruction of the self within the real world through three different stages, the player is stuck within a daydream in which they have to answer riddles, identify works of literature and answer existential questions. The project was made using a few different javascript libraries, including jquery, jqueryUI, RiTa, annyang, responsiveVoice and p5. Through this library, I aimed to make the project contain very little reliance on the mouse and instead prompted the player to use nothing but their heads and voices.

To accomplish this, I used jqueryUI to construct dialog boxes which would contain the questions, content or whatever else was needed, such as instructions. From there, the player would answer whatever they needed to to proceed through voice recognition with the annyang library. Moreover, after every action that matter, such as answering or trying to close the dialog window, responsiveVoice adds some flavor text out loud, mostly using the UK English voices.

To complement the topic brought up, I wanted to make the background imagery visceral and raw. This dream is not supposed to be pleasant, but a nightmare. To achieve this, I made the background using p5, in which I made ellipse object pulsate in tandem to create a fleshy type of environment. Furthermore, I used some lines for contrast and an array of  moving dot-like objects to add a dynamic feeling. The result was some sort of ‘living cave’ which induced a sort of dystopian and pessimistic feeling to the player.

The whole project was framed by two gif images created in Photoshop and Premiere which introduced and concluded the narrative. However, while the narrative from the beginning onwards leads the player to be hopeful, the ending image shows that no matter how much a single person changes, the world around them remains exactly the same. A pessimistic outlook, I know, but that was precisely the point of my project.

In terms of music used, I borrowed some music from a ‘The Binding of Isaac’ mod because they were chaotic and bold, which matched very well with the imagery I had going. Moreover, the use of chaotic music helped create a sense of dissonance between the contents of the project which required a lot of thought and mindwork. I wanted the flavor text and sounds the go against the player and not help them. I think that using such music definitely helped in that regard. Other than music, I also used some sound effect of locks opening, a heart beating and other such relevant sounds. I didn’t want to be too abstract with sound effects because while the project is a sort of ‘out of body’ experience, I still wanted it to be somewhat grounded in reality.

Since there were three distinct types of pop-ups within the project, I separated the three by music and color schemes to have a sense of progression throughout. I think this reflects the pessimistic illusion of hope that I wanted the players to have; that if you can remember yourself and acknowledge yourself compared to the rest of the world, the burden becomes less heavy. Of course, my goal was to ultimately shatter this hope with the final images.

If there is something I would want to improve, it would be the efficiency of my code, as it is very repetitive. Moreover, I would like to dive deeper into the jQueryUI CSS in order to make some neat animations. However, despite those shortcomings, I feel like I was still pretty successful at bringing my idea to life.
